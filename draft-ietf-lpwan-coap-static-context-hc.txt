        LPWAN Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) for CoAP
               draft-ietf-lpwan-coap-static-context-hc-03

Abstract

   This draft defines the way SCHC header compression can be applied to
   CoAP headers.  CoAP header structure differs from IPv6 and UDP
   protocols since the CoAP Header is flexible header with a variable
   number of options themself of a variable length.  Another important
   difference is the asymmetry in the header information used for
   request and response messages.  Most of the compression mechanisms
   have been introduced in [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc], this
   document explains how to use the SCHC compression for CoAP.

1.  Introduction

   CoAP [rfc7252] is an implementation of the REST architecture for
   constrained devices.  Nevertheless, if limited, the size of a CoAP
   header may be too large for LPWAN constraints and some compression
   may be needed to reduce the header size.

   [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc] defines a header compression
   mechanism for LPWAN network based on a static context.  The context
   is said static since the field description composing the Rules and
   the context are not learned during the packet exchanges but are
   previously defined.  The context(s) is(are) known by both ends before
   transmission.

Internet-Draft           LPWAN CoAP compression                June 2018


   A context is composed of a set of rules that are referenced by Rule
   IDs (identifiers).  A rule contains an ordered list of the fields
   descriptions containing a field ID (FID), its length (FL) and its
   position (FP) when repeated differs from 1, a direction indicator
   (DI) (upstream, downstream and bidirectional) and some associated
   Target Values (TV) which are expected in the message header.  A
   Matching Operator (MO) is associated to each header field
   description.  The rule is selected if all the MOs fit the TVs.  In
   that case, a Compression/Decompression Action (CDA) associated to
   each field defines the link between the compressed and decompressed
   value for each of the header fields.

   This document describes how the rules can be applied to CoAP flows.
   Compression of the CoAP header may be done in conjunction with the
   above layers (IPv6/UDP) or independantly.

2.  CoAP Compression with SCHC

   CoAP differs from IPv6 and UDP protocols on the following aspects:

   o  IPv6 and UDP are symmetrical protocols.  The same fields are found
      in the request and in the response, only the location in the
      header may vary (e.g. source and destination fields).  A CoAP
      request is different from a response.  For example, the URI-path
      option is mandatory in the request and is not found in the
      response, a request may contain an Accept option and the response
      a Content option.

      [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc] allows to use a message
      direction (DI) when processing the rule.

   o  Even when a field is "symmetric" (i.e. found in both directions)
      the values carried are different.  For instance the Type field
      will contain a CON value in the request and a ACK or RST value in
      the response.  Exploiting the asymmetry in compression will allow
      to send no bit in the compressed request and a single bit in the
      answer.  Same behavior can be applied to the CoAP Code field (O.OX
      code are present in the request and Y.ZZ in the answer).  The
      direction allows to split in two parts the possible values for
      each direction.

      In combination with the mapping list, the size of the compression
      residu can be reduced.

   o  In IPv6 and UDP header fields have a fixed size.  In CoAP, Token
      size may vary from 0 to 8 bytes, length is given by a field in the
      header.  More systematically, the CoAP options are described using
      the Type-Length-Value.  When applying SCHC header compression.

      [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc] offers the possibility to
      define a function for the Field Length in the Field Description.

   o  In CoAP headers a field can be duplicated several times, for
      instances, elements of an URI (path or queries).  The position
      defined in a rule, associated to a Field ID, can be used to
      identify the proper element.

      [I-D.ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc] allows a Field id to
      appears several times in the rule, the Field Position (FP) removes
      ambiguities for the matching operation.

   o  CoAP also obeys to the client/server paradigm and the compression
      rate can be different if the request is issued from an LPWAN node
      or from an non LPWAN device.  For instance a Device (Dev) aware of
      LPWAN constraints can generate a 1 byte token, but a regular CoAP
      client will certainly send a larger token to the Thing.  SCHC
      compression will not modify the values to offer a better
      compression rate.  Nevertheless a proxy placed before the
      compressor may change some field values to offer a better
      compression rate and maintain the necessary context for
      interoperability with existing CoAP implementations.

3.  Compression of CoAP header fields

   This section discusses of the compression of the different CoAP
   header fields.  These are just examples.  The compression should take
   into account the nature of the traffic and not only the field values.

3.1.  CoAP version field (2 bits)

   This field is bidirectional and must be elided during the SCHC
   compression, since it always contains the same value.  In the future,
   if new version of CoAP are defined, new rules will have to defined
   leading to no ambiguities between versions.

3.2.  CoAP type field

   [rfc7252] defines 4 types of messages: CON, NON, ACK and RST.  The
   latter two ones are a response of the two first ones.  If the device
   plays a specific role, a rule can exploit these property with the
   mapping list: [CON, NON] for one direction and [ACK, RST] for the
   other direction.  Compression residue is reduced to 1 bit.

   The field must elided if for instance the client is sending only NON
   or CON messages.

   In any case, a rule must be define to carry RST to a client.

Internet-Draft           LPWAN CoAP compression                June 2018


3.3.  CoAP code field

   The compression of the CoAP code field follows the same principle ad
   for the CoAP type field.  If the device plays a specific role, the
   set of code values can be splitted in two parts, the resquest codes
   starting with the 0 class and the response values.

   If the device implement only a CoAP client, the request code can be
   reduced to the set of request the client is able to process.

   All the response codes should be compressed with a SCHC rule.

3.4.  CoAP Message ID field

   This field is bidirectional and is used to manage acknowledgments.
   Server memorizes the value for a EXCHANGE_LIFETIME period (by default
   247 seconds) for CON messages and a NON_LIFETIME period (by default
   145 seconds) for NON messages.  During that period, a server
   receiving the same Message ID value will process the message has a
   retransmission.  After this period, it will be processed as a new
   messages.

   In case the Device is a client, the size of the message ID field may
   the too large regarding the number of messages sent.  Client may use
   only small message ID values, for instance 4 bit long.  Therefore a
   MSB can be used to limit the size of the compression residue.

   Note taht the client may also inform the server that the
   EXCHANGE_LIFETIME it is execpting from the server using the Time
   Scale option.

   In case the Device is a server, client may be located outside of the
   LPWAN area and view the device as a regular device connected to the
   internet.  The client will generate Message ID using the 16 bits
   space offered by this field.  A CoAP proxy can be set before the SCHC
   C/D to reduce the value of the Message ID, to allow its compression
   with the MSB matching operator and LSB CDA.

   TODO: add a reference to Time Scale

3.5.  CoAP Token field

   Token is defined through two CoAP fields, Token Length in the
   mandatory header and Token Value directly following the mandatory
   CoAP header.

   Token Length is processed as a tradition protocol field.  If the
   value remains the same during all the transaction, the size can be

   stored in the context and elided during the transmission.  Otherwize
   it will have to the send as a compression residue.

   Token Value size should not be defined directly in the rule if the
   Field Length (FL).  Instead a specific function designed as "TKL"
   must be used.  This function informs the SCHC C/D that the length of
   this field has to be read from the Token Length field.

4.  CoAP options

4.1.  CoAP option Content-format field.

   This field is unidirectional and must not be set to bidirectional in
   a rule entry.  It is used only by the server to inform the client
   about of the payload type and is never found in client requests.

   If single value is expected by the client, the TV contains that value
   and MO is set to "equal" and the CDF is set to "not-sent".  The
   examples below describe the rules for an ES acting as a server.

   FID     FL FP DI  TV    MO     CDA    Sent
   content 16 1  up value equal not-sent

   If several possible value are expected by the client, a matching-list
   can be used.

   FID     FL FP DI   TV         MO           CDA       Sent
   content 16 1  up [50, 41] match-mapping mapping-sent [1]

   Otherwise the value can be sent.The value-sent CDF in the compressor
   do not send the option type and the decompressor reconstruct it
   regarding the position in the rule.

   FID     FL FP DI   TV   MO     CDA       Sent
   content 16 1  up      ignore value-sent [0-16]

4.2.  CoAP option Accept field

   This field is unidirectional and must not be set to bidirectional in
   a rule entry.  It is used only by the client to inform of the
   possible payload type and is never found in server response.

   The number of accept options is not limited and can vary regarding
   the usage.  To be selected a rule must contain the exact number about
   accept options with their positions.  Since the order in which the
   Accept value are sent, the position order can be modified.  The rule
   below

Internet-Draft           LPWAN CoAP compression                June 2018


   FID    FL FP DI  TV   MO    CDA    Sent
   accept 16 1  up  41  egal not-sent
   accept 16 2  up  50  egal not-sent

   will be selected only if two accept options are in the CoAP header if
   this order.

   The rule below:

   FID    FL FP DI  TV  MO     CDA    Sent
   accept 16 0  up  41 egal  not-sent
   accept 16 0  up  50 egal  not-sent

   will accept a-only CoAP messages with 2 accept options, but the order
   will not influence the rule selection.  The decompression will
   reconstruct the header regarding the rule order.

   Otherwise a matching-list can be applied to the different values, in
   that case the order is important to recover the appropriate value and
   the position must be clearly indicate.

   FID    FL FP DI    TV       MO             CDA     Sent
   accept 16 1  up [50,41] match-mapping mapping-sent  [1]
   accept 16 2  up [50,61] match-mapping mapping-sent  [1]
   accept 16 3  up [61,71] match-mapping mapping-sent  [1]

   Finally, the option can be explicitly sent.

   FID    FL FP DI  TV    MO       CDA     Sent
   accept    1  up      ignore  value-sent

4.3.  CoAP option Max-Age field, CoAP option Uri-Host and Uri-Port
      fields

   This field is unidirectional and must not be set to bidirectional in
   a rule entry.  It is used only by the server to inform of the caching
   duration and is never found in client requests.

   If the duration is known by both ends, value can be elided on the
   LPWAN.

   A matching list can be used if some wellknown values are defined.

   Otherwise the option length and value can be sent on the LPWAN.

   [[note: we can reduce (or create a new option) the unit to minute,
   second is small for LPWAN ]]

5.  CoAP option Uri-Path and Uri-Query fields

   This fields are unidirectional and must not be set to bidirectional
   in a rule entry.  They are used only by the client to access to a
   specific resource and are never found in server response.

   The Matching Operator behavior has not changed, but the value must
   take a position value, if the entry is repeated :

   FID      FL FP DI  TV    MO      CDA    Sent
   URI-Path    1  up  foo  equal  not-sent
   URI-Path    2  up  bar  equal  not-sent

                         Figure 1: Position entry.

   For instance, the rule Figure 1 matches with /foo/bar, but not /bar/
   foo.

   When the length is not clearly indicated in the rule, the value
   length must be sent with the field data, which means for CoAP to send
   directly the CoAP option with length and value.

   For instance for a CoMi path /c/X6?k="eth0" the rule can be set to:

   FID       FL FP DI    TV     MO        CDA     Sent
   URI-Path     1  up    c     equal    not-sent
   URI-Path     2  up         ignore   value-sent
   URI-Query    1  up    k=   MSB (16)    LSB

                      Figure 2: CoMi URI compression

   Figure 2 shows the parsing and the compression of the URI. where c is
   not sent.  The second element is sent with the length (i.e. 0x2 X 6)
   followed by the query option (i.e. 0x05 "eth0").

   A Mapping list can be used to reduce size of variable Paths or
   Queries.  In that case, to optimize the compression, several elements
   can be regrouped into a single entry.  Numbering of elements do not
   change, MO comparison is set with the first element of the matching.

   FID       FL FP DI    TV         MO        CDA    Sent
   URI-Path     1  up  {0:"/c/c",  equal   not-sent
                        1:"/c/d"
   URI-Path     3  up             ignore   value-sent
   URI-Query    1  up   k=       MSB (16)     LSB

   For instance, the following Path /foo/bar/variable/stable can leads
   to the rule defined Figure 3.

5.1.  CoAP option Proxy-URI and Proxy-Scheme fields

   These fields are unidirectional and must not be set to bidirectional
   in a rule entry.  They are used only by the client to access to a
   specific resource and are never found in server response.

   If the field value must be sent, TV is not set, MO is set to "ignore"
   and CDF is set to "value-sent.  A mapping can also be used.

   Otherwise the TV is set to the value, MO is set to "equal" and CDF is
   set to "not-sent"

5.2.  CoAP option ETag, If-Match, If-None-Match, Location-Path and
      Location-Query fields

   These fields are unidirectional.

   These fields values cannot be stored in a rule entry.  They must
   always be sent with the request.

   [[Can include OSCOAP Object security in that category ]]

6.  Other RFCs

6.1.  Block

   Block option should be avoided in LPWAN.  The minimum size of 16
   bytes can be incompatible with some LPWAN technologies.

   [[Note: do we recommand LPWAN fragmentation since the smallest value
   of 16 is too big?]]

6.2.  Observe

   [rfc7641] defines the Observe option.  The TV is not set, MO is set
   to "ignore" and the CDF is set to "value-sent".  SCHC does not limit
   the maximum size for this option (3 bytes).  To reduce the
   transmission size either the Thing implementation should limit the
   value increase or a proxy can be used limit the increase.

   Since RST message may be sent to inform a server that the client do
   not require Observe response, a rule must allow the transmission of
   this message.

Internet-Draft           LPWAN CoAP compression                June 2018


6.3.  No-Response

   [rfc7967]  defines an No-Response option limiting the responses made
   by a server to a request.  If the value is not by both ends, then TV
   is set to this value, MO is set to "equal" and CDF is set to "not-
   sent".

   Otherwise, if the value is changing over time, TV is not set, MO is
   set to "ignore" and CDF to "value-sent".  A matching list can also be
   used to reduce the size.

7.  Protocol analysis

8.  Examples of CoAP header compression

8.1.  Mandatory header with CON message

   In this first scenario, the LPWAN compressor receives from outside
   client a POST message, which is immediately acknowledged by the
   Thing.  For this simple scenario, the rules are described Figure 4.

   The version  and Token Length fields are elided.  Code has shrunk to
   5 bits

   using the matching list (as the one given

   #<!--{{Fig--example-code-mapping}}-->  0.01 is value 0x01 and 2.05 is
      value 0x0c) Message-ID has shrunk to 9 bits to preserve alignment
      on byte boundary.  The most significant bit must be set to 0
      through a CoAP proxy.  Uri-Path contains a single element
      indicated in the matching operator.

   Figure 5 shows the time diagram of the exchange.  A LPWAN Application
   Server sends a CON message.  Compression reduces the header sending
   only the Type, a mapped code and the least 9 significant bits of
   Message ID.  The receiver decompresses the header. .

   The CON message is a request, therefore the LC process to a dynamic
   mapping.  When the ES receives the ACK message, this will not
   initiate locally a message ID mapping since it is a response.  The LC
   receives the ACK and uncompressed it to restore the original value.
   Dynamic Mapping context lifetime follows the same rules as message ID
   duration.

   The message can be further optimized by setting some fields
   unidirectional, as described in Figure 6.  Note that Type is no more
   sent in the compressed format, Compressed Code size in not changed in
   that example (8 values are needed to code all the requests and 21 to
   code all the responses in the matching list
